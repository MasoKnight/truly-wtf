			<p>Learning from hack smarter</p>
			<p>I think I will make a program that makes posting notes to this site easier. At the moment all my stuff is in Google Docs and I would like to be able to post my progress here. To do that though will be hard as the formating and fiddeling will likely slow me down so much that it will be a hinderence to my learnign. I think creaing a program that posts to here would be good. It will likely have to be a push to a page template, I would like it to be in a sequencial order so that you can read the next notes but clicking next. All solved problems I know, but not solved by me and I am excided to give it a go.</p>

			<h3>Pen Tester Labs</h3>
			<p>I have done Pen Tester Labs in the past learning SQL injection, however I lost motivation as one of their chalenges broke and it took me a long time to realise that it wasn't me messing up.</p>
